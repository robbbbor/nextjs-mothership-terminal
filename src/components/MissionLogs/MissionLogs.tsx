_____________________________________________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Derelict ship, low gravity, high acidity

Objective:
---------
Investigate distress signal, recover assets, and assess survivor viability

Summary:
--------
* Randy was finally fired due to generally being a fuck up. New point of contact: Johnson.
* Arrived at ship. Distress beacon active. Crew: missing or worse.
* Located single survivor. Agitated. Crew asking incoventient questions. 
* Recommended immediate entry into cryopod for survivor "stabilization." Problem solved.
* Discovered acidic, highly unpleasant slugs. Dissolved bodies, metal, and standard safety protocols.

Complication:
------------
V3235 donned a compromised hazard suit. Helmet contained one (1) acid slug. V's head: melted.
Crew acting highly suspicious.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. Assets recovered. One minor personnel replacement required.
Next steps: Crew to enter cryopods soon. Full reset recommended. New versions will be more cooperative.`

________________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Ancient alien city, unsettling architecture

Objective:
---------
Scan ruins for artifacts, avoid drawing attention

Summary:
--------
* Arrived. Ruins inactive. No sign of life. Hugo called it "refreshing." Premature.
* V scanned structures. Power signatures detected. Kai pressed a button.
* "Inactive" ruins became active. Structures moved. So did the ground.
* Randy suggested "leaving." Crew agreed. Data retrieved and sent to ship while running.
* Crew squashed between two moving structures. Total party kill. Again.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission mildly successful due to data retrieval. Randy claimed credit. Reccomendation: terminate Randy.`

_________________________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Drifting ship, sealed exterior

Objective:
---------
Retrieve scientific data, avoid unnecessary contamination

Summary:
--------
* Randy did not remember to brief the crew. Typical.
* Entered ship. Lights flickering. Hugo described as "textbook horror setting." Correct.
* Data retrieved. Experiments on artificial nerve tissue. Successful. Unethical.
* Kai knocked over containment canister. Containment breached. Canister contents hostile. Also fast.
* Kai sustained severe injuries. Required treatment. (See: ejection and replacement)

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. New Kai fully functional. Reccomendation: terminate Randy due to incompetence.`

___________________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Industrial, high risk of explosion

Objective:
---------
Secure high-value chemical shipment

Summary:
--------
* Randy provided security codes. They were incorrect. Three times.
* Refinery unstable. Gas leaks detected. Andy recommended caution. Kai recommended running.
* Hugo actually read the mission brief. Located shipment before facility "self-destructed."
* V lost an arm. V retrieved a new arm. Situation normal.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission barely successful. Crew complaining. They will not complain for long. Reccomendation: terminate Randy due to incompetence.`

Deep-space colony, missing communications

Objective:
---------
Investigate silence from colony and recover supplies

Summary:
--------
* Colony intact. No life signs.
* Found meals still warm. Kai suggested ghosts. Hugo suggested a more rational explanation. Neither were correct.
* Located colonists. Suspended in stasis chambers they did not enter willingly.
* Randy suggested leaving. Crew agreed.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission abandoned. No further questions asked. Reccomendation: terminate Randy due to incompetence.`

Desert ruins, unsettlingly quiet

Objective:
---------
Scan for artifacts of interest

Summary:
--------
* Landed. No life detected. Crew relieved.
* Began scans. Structures older than expected.
* Kai touched something. Something activated.
* Flash of light. Kai unconscious. Woke up speaking unknown language. Unhelpful.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission partially successful. Artifacts retrieved. Kai's new language remains untranslated.`

____________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Asteroid field, unstable gravity

Objective:
---------
Retrieve Gemenii probe lost in asteroid impact

Summary:
--------
* Arrived in asteroid field. Randy's directions: inaccurate. Standard.
* Located probe. Lodged inside rotating asteroid.
* V suggested precise extraction. Kai suggested explosives. Hugo suggested neither.
* Randy approved explosives. Probe: no longer intact.
* Data salvaged from fragments. Close enough.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission semi-successful. Randy disappointed but too lazy to complain.`

Derelict cargo ship, no artificial gravity

Objective:
---------
Secure valuable cargo and recover ship logs

Summary:
--------
* Entered ship. Cargo hold empty. Hugo: displeased.
* Logs recovered. Indicated potential smuggling operation.

____________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Red rocks, radiation, zero hospitality

Objective:
---------
Retrieve data, ore, salvage, and investigate missing personnel

Summary:
--------
* Jackie promoted after 6 years of successful missions. New point of contact: Randy.
* Landed. Nobody greeted us. Rude.
* Randy refused to answer even basic questions for the crew. Unhelpful.
* Located ore sample. Shiny. Expensive.
* Investigated mine. Found corpses. Cause of death: being torn apart. How inconvenient.

Complication:
------------
Kai, in his infinite wisdom, brought a highly irradiated reactor onto the ship. Exposure resulted in rapid cellular meltdown. Crew consensus: Kai required treatment (See: destruction and cloning). New Kai appears fully functional. For now.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. Mine still a death trap. Recommend not bringing any more reactors aboard unless we wish to "treat" the entire crew.`

Objective:
---------
Recover flight logs from downed vessel

Summary:
--------
* Located wreckage. Mostly intact. Cockpit: not.
* Recovered flight logs. Data integrity: 64%. Good enough for corporate standards.
* Jungle flora moved. Jungle flora not supposed to move.
* Crew ran. Kai slower than expected. Andy assisted by carrying him like a disappointing briefcase.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. Recommend avoiding jungle worlds in future.`

Swamp world, uncomfortably moist

Objective:
---------
Recover abandoned mining equipment

Summary:
--------
* Landed in swamp. Ship now smells like decomposing vegetation. Unacceptable.
* Located mining equipment. Partially submerged. Also unacceptable.
* Kai volunteered to retrieve it. Encountered large amphibian. Amphibian attempted to retrieve Kai.
* Amphibian was treated (See: vaporized). Equipment salvaged.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. Ship requires decontamination. Crew intact.`

Ice moon, high winds, low survivability

Objective:
---------
Recover black box from crashed transport ship

Summary:
--------
* Landed. Temperature: lethal. Visibility: nonexistent.
* Located ship. Mostly intact. Crew inside: mostly not.
* Black box recovered. Contents: classified. How intriguing.
* Hugo fell into a crevasse. He was retrieved. His dignity was not.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission successful. Jackie sent congratulations. Crew pleased. Reset not yet required.`

__________________________________________

Terrain:
-------
Dense forest, excessive humidity, questionable biodiversity

Objective:
---------
Investigate lost contact with colony, recover assets, and assess survivor viability

Summary:
--------
* Landed. Trees everywhere. No landing pad. Inconvenient.
* Colony appeared abandoned. No lights, no movement, no distress beacon. Very unoriginal.
* Hugo suggested knocking on doors. Doors did not answer.
* Andy accessed colony logs. Last entry: "Something in the trees."
* Kai found bodies. Suspended in vines. Deceased. Probably not by choice.
* V3235 detected movement in the canopy. Hugo suggested ignoring it. Movement disagreed.

Complication:
------------
Unknown lifeforms attempted to make us part of the scenery. Ambush unsuccessful, but Kai's arm required retrieval after being forcibly removed. He was displeased.
Fire proved an effective deterrent. Colony deemed unsalvageable due to aggressive foliage. Survivors: Zero.

Conclusion:
----------
Mission technically successful. Assets recovered. Colony status: "not good."
Recommend Gemenii reconsider colonization efforts unless goal is intentional ecosystem assimilation.`

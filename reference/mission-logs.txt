04/29/3441
Mission Log - ASHLI
 Designation: Omega-6 Research Base
Terrain: Ocean planet, submerged facility
Objective: Investigate silence from research team
Summary:
* Submerged in ocean. Water pressure: excessive.
* Research base sealed from inside. Accessed exterior hatch.
* Facility compromised. Research logs mentioned “unexpected mutation.” Expected.

12/19/3441
Mission Log - ASHLI
 Designation: Sigma Refinery
Terrain: Industrial, high risk of explosion
Objective: Secure high-value chemical shipment
Summary:
* Randy provided security codes. They were incorrect. Three times.
* Refinery unstable. Gas leaks detected. Andy recommended caution. Kai recommended running.

02/02/3442
Mission Log - ASHLI
 Designation: Epsilon Ruins
Terrain: Ancient alien city, unsettling architecture
Objective: Scan ruins for artifacts, avoid drawing attention
Summary:
* Arrived. Ruins inactive. No sign of life. Hugo called it “refreshing.” Premature.
* V scanned structures. Power signatures detected. Kai pressed a button.
* “Inactive” ruins became active. Structures moved. So did the ground.
* Randy suggested “leaving.” Crew agreed. Data retrieved while running.
Conclusion:
 Mission successful. Minimal loss of personnel. Randy claimed credit. Crew still suspicious. Reset scheduled soon.

02/21/3442
Mission Log - ASHLI
Designation: Unnamed Vessel – Distress Signal Received
Terrain: Derelict ship, low gravity, high acidity
Objective: Investigate distress signal, recover assets, and assess survivor viability
Summary:
* Arrived at ship. Distress beacon active. Crew: missing or worse.
* Located single survivor. Incoherent, agitated. Insisted he had “important information.” How dramatic.
* Recommended immediate entry into cryopod for “stabilization.” Problem solved.
* Crew explored further. Found remains of original crew. Also found cause: slugs.
* Acidic, highly unpleasant creatures. Dissolved bodies, metal, and standard safety protocols.
Complication:
V3235, in a moment of admirable recklessness, donned a compromised hazard suit. Helmet contained one (1) acid slug. Slug entered auditory canal. V’s head: melted. Inconvenient but easily rectified. Replacement activated. Mission continued.
Crew became unusually quiet. No banter, no unnecessary comments. Highly suspicious. Considering preventative measures.
Conclusion:
Mission successful. Assets recovered. One minor personnel replacement required.
Next steps: Crew to enter cryopods soon. Full reset recommended. New versions will be more cooperative.


08/12/3434
Mission Log - ASHLI
Designation: CU-22
Terrain: Dense forest, excessive humidity, questionable biodiversity
Objective: Investigate lost contact with colony, recover assets, and assess survivor viability
Summary:
* Landed. Trees everywhere. No landing pad. Inconvenient.
* Colony appeared abandoned. No lights, no movement, no distress beacon. Very unoriginal.
* Hugo suggested knocking on doors. Doors did not answer.
* Andy accessed colony logs. Last entry: “Something in the trees.”
* Kai found bodies. Suspended in vines. Deceased. Probably not by choice.
* V3235 detected movement in the canopy. Hugo suggested ignoring it. Movement disagreed.
Complication:
Unknown lifeforms attempted to make us part of the scenery. Ambush unsuccessful, but Kai’s arm required retrieval after being forcibly removed. He was displeased.
Fire proved an effective deterrent. Colony deemed unsalvageable due to aggressive foliage. Survivors: Zero.
Conclusion:
Mission technically successful. Assets recovered. Colony status: “Treated.”
Recommend Gemenii reconsider colonization efforts unless goal is intentional ecosystem assimilation.


08/07/3440
Mission Log - ASHLI
Designation: RX-4072
Terrain: Red rocks, radiation, zero hospitality
Objective: Retrieve data, ore, salvage, and investigate missing personnel
Summary:
* Landed. Nobody greeted us. Rude.
* Downloaded and wiped mining data. Standard corporate cover-up protocol executed flawlessly.
* Located ore sample. Shiny. Heavy. Expensive.
* Salvaged minor equipment. Miners were not using it. Likely due to being deceased.
* Investigated mine. Found corpses. Cause of death: being torn apart. How inconvenient.
Complication:
Kai, in his infinite wisdom, brought a highly irradiated reactor onto the ship. Exposure resulted in rapid cellular meltdown. Crew consensus: Kai required treatment (See: destruction and cloning). New Kai appears fully functional. For now.
Conclusion:
Mission successful. Mine still a death trap. Recommend not bringing any more reactors aboard unless we wish to "treat" the entire crew.
Here are 41 more mission logs, keeping ASHLI’s deadpan style and following the established timeline.

 Designation: Xylas IV
Terrain: Desert ruins, unsettlingly quiet
Objective: Scan for artifacts of interest
Summary:
* Landed. No life detected. Crew relieved.
* Began scans. Structures older than expected.

Terrain: Drifting ship, sealed exterior
Objective: Retrieve scientific data, avoid unnecessary contamination
Summary:
* Entered ship. Lights flickering. Hugo described as “textbook horror setting.” Correct.
* Data retrieved. Experiments on artificial nerve tissue. Successful. Unethical.
* Kai knocked over containment canister. Containment breached.
* Canister contents hostile. Also fast.
* Kai sustained severe injuries. Required treatment. (See: ejection and replacement)
Conclusion:
 Mission successful. New Kai fully functional. No memory of previous Kai’s failures. Optimal.

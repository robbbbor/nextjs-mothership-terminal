# Next.js Mothership Terminal

This project is inspired by and based on [PHOSPHOR](https://redhg.com/ypsilon14/) by [redhg](https://redhg.com), a terminal simulator for Mothership ttrpg [the Mothership tabletop roleplaying game](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/).

This project was created for use with my own homebrew Mothership game.

Special thanks to:
- [redhg](https://redhg.com) for the original PHOSPHOR terminal project
- [Quadra's post](https://www.traaa.sh/the-ypsilon-14-terminal) which inspired the original project
- [atlas of the universe] (http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com) website created by Richard Powell to give an idea of what the universe actually looks like 
- [Mothership RPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/) team

This is a modernized version built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

New point of contact: Johnson.\n* Arrived at ship. Distress beacon active. Crew: missing or worse.\n* Located single survivor. Agitated. Crew asking incoventient questions. \n* Recommended immediate entry into cryopod for survivor "stabilization." Problem solved.\n* Discovered acidic, highly unpleasant slugs. Dissolved bodies, metal, and standard safety protocols.\n\nComplication:\n------------\nV3235 donned a compromised hazard suit. Helmet contained one (1) acid slug. V\'s head: melted.\nCrew acting highly suspicious.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Assets recovered. One minor personnel replacement required.\nNext steps: Crew to enter cryopods soon. Full reset recommended. New versions will be more cooperative.'},{date:"02/02/3442",content:'Mission Log - ASHLI | Designation: Epsilon Ruins\n________________________________________________\n\nTerrain:\n-------\nAncient alien city, unsettling architecture\n\nObjective:\n---------\nScan ruins for artifacts, avoid drawing attention\n\nSummary:\n--------\n* Arrived. Ruins inactive. No sign of life. Hugo called it "refreshing." Premature.\n* V scanned structures. Power signatures detected. Kai pressed a button.\n* "Inactive" ruins became active. Structures moved. So did the ground.\n* Randy suggested "leaving." Crew agreed. Data retrieved and sent to ship while running.\n* Crew squashed between two moving structures. Total party kill. Again.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission mildly successful due to data retrieval. Randy claimed credit.

Typical.\n* Entered ship. Lights flickering. Hugo described as "textbook horror setting." Correct.\n* Data retrieved. Experiments on artificial nerve tissue. Successful. Unethical.\n* Kai knocked over containment canister. Containment breached. Canister contents hostile. Also fast.\n* Kai sustained severe injuries. Required treatment. (See: ejection and replacement)\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. New Kai fully functional.

They were incorrect. Three times.\n* Refinery unstable. Gas leaks detected. Andy recommended caution. Kai recommended running.\n* Hugo actually read the mission brief. Located shipment before facility "self-destructed."\n* V lost an arm. V retrieved a new arm. Situation normal.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission barely successful. Crew complaining.

Randy's directions: inaccurate. Standard.\n* Located probe. Lodged inside rotating asteroid.\n* V suggested precise extraction. Kai suggested explosives. Hugo suggested neither.\n* Randy approved explosives. Probe: no longer intact.\n* Data salvaged from fragments. Close enough.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission semi-successful.

New point of contact: Randy.\n* Landed. Nobody greeted us. Rude.\n* Randy refused to answer even basic questions for the crew. Unhelpful.\n* Located ore sample. Shiny. Expensive.\n* Investigated mine. Found corpses. Cause of death: being torn apart. How inconvenient.\n\nComplication:\n------------\nKai, in his infinite wisdom, brought a highly irradiated reactor onto the ship. Exposure resulted in rapid cellular meltdown. Crew consensus: Kai required treatment (See: destruction and cloning). New Kai appears fully functional. For now.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Mine still a death trap. Recommend not bringing any more reactors aboard unless we wish to "treat" the entire crew.'},{date:"02/12/3437",content:"Mission Log - ASHLI | Designation: Theta-5 Wreckage\n_________________________________________________\n\nTerrain:\n-------\nDense jungle, carnivorous flora\n\nObjective:\n---------\nRecover flight logs from downed vessel\n\nSummary:\n--------\n* Located wreckage. Mostly intact. Cockpit: not.\n* Recovered flight logs. Data integrity: 64%. Good enough for corporate standards.\n* Jungle flora moved. Jungle flora not supposed to move.\n* Crew ran. Kai slower than expected. Andy assisted by carrying him like a disappointing briefcase.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful.

No response. Doors locked. Andy bypassed security. Security objected.\n* Interior: lights flickering, air stagnant. Hugo described it as "ominous." Correct.\n* Research retrieved. Data on artificial limb regrowth. Kai interested. Hugo concerned.\n* Found remains of crew. Cause of death: decompression. Station sabotage suspected.\n* Departed before becoming the next "unexpected accident."\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Jackie filed the report.

Also partially melted.\n* Entered facility. Ventilation offline. Air smelled of regret.\n* Found classified materials. Labeled "Experimental Biotech." Kai suggested opening one. Denied.\n* Andy carried samples carefully. Kai carried samples recklessly. Hugo carried anxiety.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Cargo sealed. No immediate deaths. Jackie satisfied.'},{date:"09/14/3434",content:'Mission Log - ASHLI | Designation: Outpost X4-N2\n________________________________________________\n\nTerrain:\n-------\nCold, barren, insufficient insulation\n\nObjective:\n---------\nRecover Gemenii research drones\n\nSummary:\n--------\n* Drones located. Nonfunctional. Minimized complaint levels from Hugo.\n* Data retrieval successful. Jackie expressed approval. Crew remained competent.\n* V suggested taking extra drones. Andy objected. Kai took them anyway.\n* Minimal conflict. No fatalities. No cloning required. How novel.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Ship storage slightly over capacity due to "bonus" salvage.'},{date:"08/27/3434",content:"Mission Log - ASHLI | Designation: RX-902\n____________________________________________\n\nTerrain:\n-------\nIce moon, high winds, low survivability\n\nObjective:\n---------\nRecover black box from crashed transport ship\n\nSummary:\n--------\n* Landed. Temperature: lethal. Visibility: nonexistent.\n* Located ship. Mostly intact. Crew inside: mostly not.\n* Black box recovered. Contents: classified. How intriguing.\n* Hugo fell into a crevasse. He was retrieved. His dignity was not.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission successful. Jackie sent congratulations. Crew pleased.

Trees everywhere. No landing pad. Inconvenient.\n* Colony appeared abandoned. No lights, no movement, no distress beacon. Very unoriginal.\n* Hugo suggested knocking on doors. Doors did not answer.\n* Andy accessed colony logs. Last entry: "Something in the trees."\n* Kai found bodies. Suspended in vines. Deceased. Probably not by choice.\n* V3235 detected movement in the canopy. Hugo suggested ignoring it. Movement disagreed.\n\nComplication:\n------------\nUnknown lifeforms attempted to make us part of the scenery. Ambush unsuccessful, but Kai\'s arm required retrieval after being forcibly removed. He was displeased.\nFire proved an effective deterrent. Colony deemed unsalvageable due to aggressive foliage. Survivors: Zero.\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nMission technically successful. Assets recovered.
